As you have seen, trying out different model features and properties is a tedious process but there is where the \"magic\" lies: optimal model design is usually very specific to the task at hand (but for a counterexample of this, see the field of transfer learning) and usually depends on domain knowledge. There are more systematic ways of tuning our parameters compared to just trial and error that we have tried till now. For this part, let's fix the model architecture and only consider the learning rate as it is a one-dimensional parameters for simplicity. Go over https://neptune.ai/blog/hyperparameter-tuning-in-python-complete-guide and implement one of the methods of hyperparamter tuning described."
